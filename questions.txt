- Does the airports.csv file always look the same? If so, can we make it "part of the program?"
- Are the number of nodes approx the same? (Are there other invariants? for example the distribution of nodes)
- How presise does the heirartical clustering need to be?
- Does the bonus question add to the score? in what?
- the links don't work
